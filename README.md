Borefts 2015
============

The official Android companion app to the Borefts Beer Festival 2015, as organised yearly by brewery De Molen. For everything on the festival itself, please visit [the offical festival website](http://brouwerijdemolen.nl/borefts-bierfestival/).

This app was build by [Eric Kok](http://ekok.nl) of [2312 development](http://2312.nl) as a continuation of the 2013 and 2014 apps. However, we are now open-source! So feel free to contribute or to modify for your own (festival) needs. Remeber, though, the GNU GPLv3 license is copyleft, so every single change or addition needs to be open-sourced under the same license.
